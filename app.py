    üìä **Scree Plot Insights:**
    - The first principal component (PC1) explains {explained_variance_ratio[0]:.2%} of the total variance in the data.
    - PC2 adds another {explained_variance_ratio[1]:.2%}, bringing the cumulative explained variance to {cumulative_variance_ratio[1]:.2%}.
    - We reach {cumulative_variance_ratio[2]:.2%} cumulative explained variance with just 3 principal components.
    - This suggests that the compensation structure in San Francisco can be largely understood through these first few components.

    - PC2 is most heavily weighted on {pc2_top_feature} (coefficient: {pca_components.loc[pc2_top_feature, 'PC2']:.2f}).
    This indicates that {pc2_top_feature} plays a key role in differentiating compensation structures beyond just total amount.

    st.write(f"""
    1. **Dimensionality Reduction**: We can capture {cumulative_variance_ratio[2]:.2%} of the variance in compensation data using just 3 principal components, simplifying our 9-dimensional data significantly.

    2. **Primary Compensation Driver**: The first principal component, heavily influenced by {pc1_top_feature}, explains the majority of variance ({explained_variance_ratio[0]:.2%}). This suggests that {pc1_top_feature} is the most critical factor in determining an employee's overall compensation.

    3. **Compensation Structure Insights**: The second principal component, primarily weighted on {pc2_top_feature}, reveals additional nuances in compensation structure, possibly highlighting differences between job roles or departments.

    4. **Efficient Analysis**: By focusing on these principal components, we can efficiently analyze and compare employee compensations, potentially identifying outliers or groups with unique compensation structures.

    5. **Policy Implications**: Understanding these principal components can guide policy decisions. For example, adjustments to {pc1_top_feature} would have the most significant impact on overall compensation levels, while changes to {pc2_top_feature} might affect the balance of compensation components.

    st.write(f"""
    Based on the analysis of the San Francisco employee compensation data, here are data-specific insights and recommendations:

    1. Compensation Structure:
       - Average Salary: ${avg_salary:,.2f}
       - Average Benefits: ${avg_benefits:,.2f}
       - Average Total Compensation: ${avg_total_comp:,.2f}
       - The highest-paid job is "{highest_paid_job}"
       - The department with the highest average compensation is "{highest_paid_dept}"

    Recommendation: Review the compensation structure, especially for departments and roles significantly above or below these averages.

    2. Benefits Analysis:
       - Benefits make up {(avg_benefits/avg_total_comp)*100:.1f}% of the average total compensation.
    
    Recommendation: Evaluate the benefits package, especially for roles where it constitutes a larger portion of total compensation.

    3. Overtime Patterns:
       - {(df['Overtime'] > 0).mean()*100:.1f}% of employees received overtime pay.
       - Average overtime pay for those who received it: ${df[df['Overtime'] > 0]['Overtime'].mean():,.2f}
    
    Recommendation: Investigate departments with high overtime costs to optimize workforce management.

    4. Job Family Analysis:

    job_family_stats = df.groupby('Job Family')['Total Compensation'].agg(['mean', 'median', 'std']).sort_values('mean', ascending=False)
    st.write(job_family_stats)
    
    st.write("""
    Recommendation: Focus on job families with high standard deviations in compensation for internal equity reviews.

    5. Clustering Insights:
       - K-Means clustering revealed distinct groups based on compensation structure.
       - Hierarchical clustering showed nested patterns in compensation, potentially related to job hierarchies.
       - DBSCAN identified outliers in compensation, which may warrant individual review.
    
    Recommendation: Use clustering results to inform targeted retention strategies and identify anomalies in compensation.

    6. PCA Insights:
       - The first two principal components explain a significant portion of the variance in compensation data.
       - This suggests that most of the variation in compensation can be captured by a few key factors.
    
    Recommendation: Focus on these key factors (likely related to job level, department, and tenure) when making compensation decisions.

    7. Algorithm Comparison:
       - K-Means performed well for identifying broad compensation groups.
       - Hierarchical clustering provided insights into the nested structure of compensation.
       - DBSCAN was effective at identifying outliers and unusual compensation patterns.
    
    Recommendation: Use a combination of these algorithms for a comprehensive view of compensation patterns and anomalies.

    8. Longitudinal Analysis:
       - Consider incorporating year-over-year data to track compensation trends over time.
       - This could reveal patterns in salary increases, changes in benefits structure, or shifts in overtime policies.

    9. Equity Considerations:
       - While demographic data is not included in this dataset, it's crucial to conduct regular pay equity analyses.
       - Consider collecting and analyzing data on gender, race, and other relevant factors to ensure equitable compensation practices.

    10. Benchmarking:
        - Compare these compensation figures with industry standards and other comparable cities.
        - This can help ensure that San Francisco remains competitive in attracting and retaining talent.

    These data-driven recommendations should be considered in the context of San Francisco's overall budget, labor agreements, and strategic workforce planning goals.
